At the middle of our MBA program in 2023, there was a new AI Artificial Intelligent service available for public testing called ChatGPT. That is the start of it all. Throughout the rest of the program a few of us begin to ponder what can we make use of this AI service. With the help of a few advisors, Owl go AI has been conceived. We have witnessed the gradual fall of enrollment in higher education. And we believe that we can leverage the generative AI to help reverse this.

Owl go AI is a personalized educational assistance which provides ethical use of AI to reach underserved communities to provide potential students with data-driven insights on college application support, course recommendations, and financial aid and scholarship. And we will partner with educational institues to provide virtual or in-person campus tours, alumni connections, and career guidances.
